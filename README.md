# ü§ñ Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Alexa Reviews üí¨

This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon Alexa reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The goal is to classify 3,150 customer reviews as either **positive** (1) or **negative** (0) based on the text of the review.

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis, the dataset used, and the final trained models.

## üéØ Purpose of the Project

The primary purpose of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can automatically analyze and classify customer feedback. In a real-world scenario, businesses can use this model to:

* **Understand Customer Sentiment:** Quickly process thousands of reviews to get a real-time pulse on customer satisfaction.
* **Identify Product Issues:** Automatically flag negative reviews to identify common problems, bugs, or areas for improvement.
* **Prioritize Feedback:** Help product teams focus on what matters most to their users.

## ‚ú® NLP & Machine Learning Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases a comprehensive, end-to-end NLP workflow, demonstrating key skills that are highly valued in data science and machine learning roles:

* **üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
    * Proficiency in cleaning raw text data using `regex` to remove punctuation and special characters.
    * Standardizing text through **lowercasing**.
    * Applying core NLP techniques like **Stopword Removal** (using NLTK) to filter out noise.
    * Implementing **Stemming** (`PorterStemmer`) to normalize words to their root form, reducing the feature space.

* **üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Analyzing data distributions (ratings, feedback imbalance) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
    * Creating effective data visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and a **Word Cloud** to communicate insights about review content.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering (Text Vectorization):**
    * Implementing the fundamental **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** model using `CountVectorizer` from scikit-learn.
    * Successfully converting unstructured text data into a numerical matrix that machine learning models can understand.

* **üß† Model Training & Evaluation:**
    * Implementing and comparing two powerful classification algorithms: **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**.
    * Evaluating model performance using standard metrics like **Accuracy Score** and the **Confusion Matrix** to understand model strengths and weaknesses.

* **üíæ Model Persistence (MLOps):**
    * Correctly saving (serializing) the trained models and the `CountVectorizer` using `pickle`.
    * This demonstrates an understanding of how to make a model reusable for future predictions or deployment in an application.

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1.  **Data Loading & Exploration:**
    * The dataset (`amazon_alexa.tsv`) is loaded and explored.
    * EDA is performed to analyze the distribution of ratings, feedback (target variable), and product variations.

2.  **Data Preprocessing (NLP):**
    * The `verified_reviews` text is cleaned by:
        * Removing punctuation and special characters.
        * Converting to lowercase.
        * Removing English stopwords.
        * Applying stemming using `PorterStemmer`.

3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    * The cleaned text is vectorized using `CountVectorizer` to create a Bag-of-Words matrix.

4.  **Model Training:**
    * The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
    * Random Forest and XGBoost models are trained on the data.

5.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * Both models are evaluated on the test set using accuracy and confusion matrices.

6.  **Model Saving:**
    * The final trained models (`model_rf.pkl`, `model_xgb.pkl`) and the `countVectorizer.pkl` are saved for future use.

## üíª How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/KartikIITH/https://github.com/KartikIITH/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Alexa-Reviews-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn xgboost wordcloud
    ```
    You will also need to download the NLTK stopwords package:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    ```

3.  **Run the Notebook:**
    Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` to see the full analysis.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
    ```

4.  **Making New Predictions:**
    You can load the saved `.pkl` models and the vectorizer to predict the sentiment of new, unseen reviews.
